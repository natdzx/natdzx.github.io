              <p>Cacique Restaurant was established in Miami, FL in 1986. Lucas "Ramon" Diaz, a political refugee in pursuit of the American Dream, started the business shortly after immigrating from Cuba with his wife and 3 kids. He wanted to bring his comforts of home and culture to the Downtown Miami Area.</p>

              <p>Today, his oldest son, Selim Diaz, has taken over the family business with his parter, Denni Diaz. Together, they take pride in managing their fast-paced world, while paying special attention to customer experience and making delicious food.</p>
